<h1>The best movies according to Darek</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Into The Wild</h3>
<p>This is the movie that changed how I think about life and initiated 
    <br>my desire to experience nature and connect with it
    <hr size="2" color="green" width="250">
    <br>I found so much beauty
    <hr size="1" color="green" width="400">
    <br>All of the things I've seen and all the nature I saw, this feeling
    <br> of belonging, feeling like being one with nature in that exact moment
    <br>  </p>
<h3>Matrix</h3>
<p>To me this is a movie that should be mandatory at certain age. The idea expressed there <br> made me question reality or at least how
perceive it</p>
<h3>Cloud Atlas</h3>
<p>Beautifully expressed the idea of reincarnation and how complex it can be</p>
